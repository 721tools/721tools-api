# KotorNinja API

[KotorNinja](https://alpha.kotor.ninja/) is a revolutionizing NFT trading platform with Layerzero and L2 Cross-Chain matchmaking.

Languages： English | [中文](README_CN.md)

# Core Concept

Mint on Ethereum, Trade on L2.

KotorNinja is a protocol that enables initial users to map NFT assets from Ethereum mainnet to L2. We build on two core concepts:

1.  NFT aggregator on Ethereum
2.  Asset ownership protocol on L2

When users use our NFT aggregator on Ethereum, they can choose to map their assets to L2. The projects on L2 can use our protocol to build decentralized NFT trading markets, lending, staking, and other businesses.

# Current Status

KotorNinja dAPP is currently at the closed Alpha stage:

1. Smart contracts deployed on Ethereum Testnet and Polygon Mumbai Testnet
2. Sweep and Limit order feature available via UI
3. Integrated order data from Opensea and Blur
